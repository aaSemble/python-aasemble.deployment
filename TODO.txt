- Add a setting of some sort to denote nodes that must have a floating IP assigned to them.
- Make remote commands connect to the nodes we've built.
- Export ALL_NODES environment to commands after provision steps
- Support long-lived deployments
  - Don't create resources that already exist (what if they don't match the config?)
